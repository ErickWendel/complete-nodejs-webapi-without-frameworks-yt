# Building a complete Node.js WebApi + testing without frameworks

Welcome, this repo is part of my youtube video about building a complete Node.js API using only raw JavaScript and new features from the Node.js Core. 

First of all, leave your start 🌟 on this repo.

Access our [**exclusive telegram channel**](https://bit.ly/ErickWendelContentHub) so I'll let you know about all the content I've been producing: 

## Features Checklist + Challenges

- Web API
    - [ ] it should have an endpoint for storing heroes' data
    - [ ] it should have an endpoint for retrieving heroes' data
    - [ ] it should have an endpoint for updating heroes' data
    - [ ] it should have an endpoint for deleting heroes' data
    - [ ] it should test when the application throws an error

- Testing
    - Unit
        - [ ] it should test all files on the routes layer
        - [ ] it should test all files on the repositories layer
        - [ ] it should test all files on the factories layer
        - Plus
          - [ ] it should reach 100% code coverage (it's currently not possible to get code coverage metrics using only the native Node.js, see [c8](https://www.npmjs.com/package/c8) for this task)

    - Integration / E2E
        - [ ] it should test the endpoint for storing heroes' data
        - [ ] it should test the endpoint for retrieving heroes' data
        - [ ] it should test the endpoint for updating heroes' data
        - [ ] it should test the endpoint for deleting heroes' data
        - [ ] it should test when the application throws an error
